It is very good real estate company but ther reason i only give 4 star is that the price of the house that I want was in bidding and I paid more than what I expected because of the competition.

Roland's Real Estate is the best. They provided me with good contacts about the house, plumber, property manager, waste disposal service, and lawyer. They did eveything for me and I do not even need to meet them face to face. It is a plus because I dont want to meet them during pandemic.</div>
